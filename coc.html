  <h1>Shower Hacks Code of Conduct</h1>

  <p>
    Shower Hacks is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for all participants,
    organizers, sponsors, and judges. This Code of Conduct applies to all hackathon spaces, including the event venue,
    online platforms, and official afterparties.
  </p>

  <h2>Respect and Inclusion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All participants must treat each other with respect. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>
    <li>Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        unwanted physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
    <li>We welcome participants regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or
        background. Discrimination in any form is unacceptable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Projects and Content</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are free to build provocative or unconventional projects. However, if a project involves technology that
        would be illegal or harmful if deployed, it must remain a proof-of-concept demonstration only. Such projects
        must be presented as demonstrations of potential risks or misuses of technology, not as functioning tools
        intended for deployment.</li>
    <li>Projects may not be used to cause harm to individuals, organizations, or communities.</li>
    <li>Participants are solely responsible for ensuring that their projects comply with these requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safety, Liability, and Conduct</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Participants are responsible for their own safety and for respecting the safety of others. You may not engage
        in activities that could cause physical, psychological, or legal harm to yourself, other participants, or the
        public.</li>
    <li>Respect the venue, equipment, and facilities provided. Any damage caused to property is the responsibility of
        the participant(s) involved.</li>
    <li>Participants are responsible for their own actions. The organizers of Shower Hacks are not liable for injuries,
        damages, or losses incurred by participants.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Afterparty Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The afterparty is restricted to participants aged 18 and over.</li>
    <li>Alcohol will only be served to those 21 years of age or older. A valid government-issued ID must be shown to
        verify age. No exceptions will be made.</li>
    <li>Participants are expected to behave responsibly. Disruptive, unsafe, or disrespectful behavior will result in
        removal from the event and possible exclusion from future hackathons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reporting Issues</h2>
  <p>
    If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to an organizer.
    All reports will be handled with discretion and taken seriously.
  </p>

  <h2>Enforcement</h2>
  <p>
    Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in warnings, removal from the event, disqualification from
    participation, or bans from future events, at the discretion of the organizers.
